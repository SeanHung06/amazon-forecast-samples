# Instructions how to install the Amazon Forecast solution

The Amazon Forecast Pre-POC workshop uses a solution that is implemented using AWS service components bundled together and deployed using an AWS CloudFormation template.  AWS CF templates are JSON or YAML that programmatically declare the AWS resources to be used and specific configurations.  The architecture components will make experimentation and iteration of Forecast models easier.

By default, the installed components of this solution do not incur any cost when not in use. 

> ⚠️ **Warning:**  SageMaker is the only AWS service in this solution you need to take extra precautions about when not in use.  As installed, it will not incur cost.  However, if you do open a SageMaker Notebook, make sure to shut down all Notebook instances when not in use, otherwise SageMaker will keep charging, even when not in use.



## Details

The CloudFormation template used in this workshop will:

* Deploy the Improving <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/improving-forecast-accuracy-with-machine-learning/automated-deployment.html" target="_blank">Improving Forecast Accuracy with Machine Learning Solution</a>, components shown in architecture diagram below.  The main stack called "forecast-stack-ForecastStack-xxxx" will be a nested stack.
* Deploy a demonstration stack called "forecast-stack" using data from the <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/" target="_blank">NYC Taxi Dataset</a>, will automatically run by itself, so you can see a demo of Amazon Forecast completely through.  
* In order to visualize using Amazon QuickSight, follow the additional steps after the CloudFormation instructions.

Below is an architecture diagram of components used in this solution, showing how it is used in Development and Production Modes.

**That’s it!  Congratulations**! You have deployed a CloudFormation template in Amazon Forecast. 



## **Optional steps for QuickSight visualization:**

**Step 1**: Sign up for [QuickSight Enterprise](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/pricing/).  QuickSight is a BI visualization tool, comparable to Tableau.  QuickSight Enterprise is $29/month (at time of writing this) which should be enough if everyone is logging in using "Admin" account.

**Step 2**: Login to AWS using Admin account.  [console.aws.amazon.com](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/QuickSightConfig.png)

After you login, copy your Account ID and save somewhere convenient. 

![](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/QuickSightGetAccountID.png)

**Step 3**: In the AWS console, top menu bar, click terminal icon to open AWS CloudShell.![terminal icon to](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/console_search_and_cloudshell.png) 

**Step 4**:  Next we need to get your QuickSight ARN.  In the CloudShell, type:

aws quicksight list-users --region us-east-1 --aws-account-id **accountID** --namespace default

* where **accountID** is number you copied in Step 2.

**Step 5**:  Copy your QuickSight ARN (Note "ARN" means "Amazon Resource Number", think of it as an AWS-specialized URL) following this pattern: <br>
"**arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:accountID:user/default/quickSight_username**" , where

- region = `us-east-1` *regardless of where you spun up the stack* (as QuickSight configuration is always performed via `us-east-1`)
- account ID = number from Step 2

Example: 

* arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:12345678901:user/default/Admin/myusername
* arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:12345678901:user/default/myusername

Copy and save your QuickSight ARN somewhere convenient and to your clipboard. 

**Step 6**: Go back to your AWS console, top menu bar, in the Search box, type "quicksight".  See image Step 3.  

Open QuickSight



#### Configure from where QuickSight is allowed to read data.

**Step 1**: From QuickSight, click  top right drop-down next to your username.  Click change region.  Choose us-east-1 N.Virginia.  (QuickSight configuration tasks only work in us-east-1).

**Step 2**: From QuickSight, click drop-down menu on top-right, next to your username.  Click "Manage Quicksight".

![](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/QuickSightConfig.png)

**Step 3**:  From QuickSight, click left-side-menu.  On the main screen, under "Security & permissions", under "QuickSight access to AWS Services", click “Add or Remove”. 

![](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/QuickSightConfigSecurity.png)

Next, you will configure which S3 buckets QuickSight can read from.

**Step 4**: Click S3 "Details".  Click "Select S3 buckets".

![](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/QuickSightConfigS3-main.png)

**Step 5**: Verify which S3 buckets you need to allow by going back to CloudFormation template.  

Open AWS console again.  [console.aws.amazon.com](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/QuickSightConfig.png)

In search box type "cloud formation" to **navigate to CloudFormation templates**.

**Click on the nested stack called "forecast-stack-ForecastStack-xxxx"** (do not click on the nested DemoDownloader ).  ![](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/cloudformation_get_s3_buckets_step0.png)

On the nested ForecastStack, **click "Outputs" tab.**

Make note of the names of your 1) AthenaBucket, 2) ForecastBucket

**Step 6**: Go back to your QuickSight console window, where you were in the middle of setting S3 permissions.  Choose forecast-stack-athenabucket and forecast-stack-data-bucket names that match what you saw in previous step.  Click "Finish".  ![](https://amazon-forecast-samples.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/images/workshops/QuickSightConfigS3.png)

<br>Next, allow QuickSight to read from both S3 and Athena.

**Step 7**: Click "Amazon S3" and "Amazon Athena" checkboxes.  Click “Update”.
